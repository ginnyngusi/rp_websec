# XSS

## What is XSS?

Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.

 

## How does XSS work?

Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.

## **Lab: Stored DOM XSS**

### Description

This lab demonstrates a stored DOM vulnerability in the blog comment functionality. To solve this lab, exploit this vulnerability to call the `alert()` function.

### Solution

`<><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`

> In an attempt to prevent [XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting), the website uses the JavaScript `replace()` function to encode angle brackets. However, when the first argument is a string, the function only replaces the first occurrence. We exploit this vulnerability by simply including an extra set of angle brackets at the beginning of the comment. These angle brackets will be encoded, but any subsequent angle brackets will be unaffected, enabling us to effectively bypass the filter and inject HTML.
