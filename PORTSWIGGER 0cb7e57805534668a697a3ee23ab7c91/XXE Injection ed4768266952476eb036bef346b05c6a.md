# XXE Injection

## **What is XML external entity injection?**

> XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web 
security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an 
application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to 
view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with 
any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access.

>  leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform [server-side request forgery](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf) (SSRF) attacks.

## **Lab: Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages**

> This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.
> 
> 
> To solve the lab, use an external DTD to trigger an error message that displays the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
> 
> The lab contains a link to an exploit server on a different domain where you can host your malicious DTD.

## Solution:

I would enable XML parsing error to read sensitive information (eg /etc/passwd file contents) with malicious external DTD. Specifically, I moved to the Exploit server, created and saved the DTD file with the following content:

*`<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">`*

*`<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfil SYSTEM 'file:///invalid/%file;'>">`*

*`%eval;`*

*`%exfil;`*

The 1st line defines the XML parameter entity 'file' that will contain the contents of the file from which I want to extract information (specifically in the above example, etc/passwd);

The second line defines the XML parameter entity 'eval' which will contain the dynamic declaration (roughly translated as dynamic declaration) for another XML parameter entity, 'exfil' (I'm using the acronym for the word exfiltrate, if you don't like it, use it. other letters are fine, but be sure to check the corresponding reference);

3rd line %eval; call a reference to the entity parameter “eval” thereby creating a dynamic declaration for the exfil entity. This process will also call the reference to the entity file to read the contents of the etc/passwd file and then get the value assigned to 'file:///invalid/%file;'. The word 'invalid' here implies that this file path is nonsense, does not exist. If you don't like it, you can change it to another word. The important part is the '%file' in the back, when processed will spit out the contents of the file 'etc/passwd' I'm craving;

Last line %exfil; will call a reference to the parameter entity entity 'exfil' to enable the above mess to run, thereby generating an error message containing the 'name' of a file that does not exist (the guy 'file:///invalid/%' file;'). And this 'name' will contain the information I am looking for (content of the file “etc/passwd“);

I select **Store** and then **View** exploit.

Run the **Check stock** function and collect the corresponding request and push it to **Burp Suite Repeater.**

Open the captured request, I slip the external entity definition between the XML declaration and the `stockCheck` element and then send the request.
