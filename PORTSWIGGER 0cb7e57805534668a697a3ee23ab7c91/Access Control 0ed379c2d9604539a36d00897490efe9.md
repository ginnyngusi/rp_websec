# Access Control

## What is Access Control?

**Access control** determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.

## **[Lab: Referer-based access control](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-referer-based-access-control)**

### Description

> This lab controls access to certain admin functionality based on the `Referer header.` You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by 
logging in using the credentials `administrator:admin`.
> 
> 
> To solve the lab, log in using the credentials `wiener:peter` and exploit the flawed [access controls](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control) to promote yourself to become an administrator.
> 

### Solution

Log in with the administrator account `administrator:admin`, access the Admin panel option, which contains the user account upgrade function.

Perform an **upgrade** of the `carlos` account to admin rights and observe the request:

![Untitled](Access%20Control%200ed379c2d9604539a36d00897490efe9/Untitled%201.png)

The request sends to the path `/admin-roles` the parameters `username=carlos&action=upgrade` using the GET method. There is also a `Referer header` having value `/admin`

So what role does this `Referer header` play, what is the effect? Try to test it by changing its value to any path

Received `'Unauthorized'` error message. This proves that the system exists a `mechanism to authenticate the user's identity via the Referer header`, in which the user must send an account upgrade request from the `/admin` path.

Login with the account `wiener:peter`, send to /admin-roles the parameters `username=wiener&action=upgrade` using the GET method, add the `Referer` header with the value [https://](https://0aed00f6031ed0b7c0c86a80009c008c.web-security-academy/)â€¦../admin
