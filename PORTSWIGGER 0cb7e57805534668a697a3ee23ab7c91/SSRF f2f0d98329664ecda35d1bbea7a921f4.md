# SSRF

## **What is SSRF?**

Server-side request forgery (also known as SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location.

In a typical SSRF attack, the attacker might cause the server to make a connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure. In other cases, they may be able to force the server to connect to arbitrary external systems, potentially leaking sensitive data such as authorization credentials.

## **Lab: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter**

### Description

> This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.
> 
> 
> To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://localhost/admin` and delete the user `carlos`.
> 
> The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.
> 

### Solution:

Which contains hostname type **127.0.0.1/localhost** or **URL /admin** it reject right away without asking. This option will improve the situation but can still be disabled if the attacker uses techniques like: 

 - Use other representations of 0.0.1, like 127.1, 2130706433 or 017700000001.

 - Build your own domain name to resolve to 0.0.1 or use `Burpcollaborator`

 - Use URL encoding and methods to disguise and hide strings in the blacklist.

Go to a product of the store and try running the Check stock function.

Then I grabbed this request from **Burp Suite Proxy HTTP history** and threw it through the **Repeater**.

Here, when I try to play the trick of changing the URL of `stockApi` to [http://127.0.0.1/](http://127.0.0.1/), I will be scolded with a `400 status code` like this.

Disguised fog fire, I tried switching to [http://127.1/](http://127.0.0.1/) and everything went fine again.

However, if I plan to switch to [http://127.1/admin](http://127.0.0.1/admin), I will be scolded again.

Once again, I had to use `double-URL encoding` to hide the forbidden word '**admin**' by turning the letter 'a' into `%2561` (when the application decodes twice, it will show form the letter “a”).

This time I was able to confidently **access the administration interface** with the powerful delete user function.

Tada =))), see what, now just do the rest, delete the user that needs to be deleted
